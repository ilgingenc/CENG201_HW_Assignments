For Task1:
Big O notation is used to measure how an algorithm's
running time changes depending on the input size.
In this report, I examined the compexities of the addPatient,
removePatient and findPatient methods in the patientList class.
addPatient method adds the patient tot the end of the list.
The whole list cannot be circulated in this method.
The time complexity of this method is O(1) because of this reason.
removePatient method goes through the list one by one by providing ID check.
The wanted element may be at the end of the list or not at all.
The time complexity of this method is O(n).
findPatient method goes through the entire list and may not find
it or may be at the end of the list.So, time complexity is O(n).
ArrayList vs Linked List:
for addPatient:Usually both have O(1)
but in ArrayList sometimes it can be O(n)
because the elements are copied when the array is full.
Find process takes O(n) time in linked list and arraylist.
Linked list is more useful in the deletion process.
For this reason, if adding and deleting are more frequent,
the Linked List is more convenient. In conclusion choosing the data
structure is very important.
